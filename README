Note:

1, To initialize tests, please go to "src/userprog/" then "make check", please be advised, we have changed the Make.vars so that the 
   default simulator is bochs.

2, We have modified line 19 of src/Make.config as "CC = gcc -m32 -march=i386 -std=gnu99", so hopefully Zulkar will not have problem compiling our code.
   
3, Modified or new files

	src/threads/
	thread.h
	thread.c
	synch.h
	synch.c

	src/filesys/
	fsutils.c

	src/userprog/
	exception.c
	process.h
	process.c
	syscall.h
	syscall.c
	Make.vars
	DESIGNDOC

4, 75/76 tests passed by using "make check" on timberlake server.
   The only test failed is "tests/userprog/no-vm/multipl-oom.c"
   This is a tricky one, for some test run it can pass with a very long runtime,
   but often times it just fails very quickly.
